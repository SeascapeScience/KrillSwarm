```{r}
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))
load("C:\\Users\\nicoleh3\\Documents\\Post-doc\\Data\\Total Merged Data File.Rdata")

head(TotalData) ## all rows of data from TotalData
head(CC.TotalData) ## ONLY complete cases of TotalData
library(scatterplot3d)

##  2D heatmaps of time spent in locations
## Looking at differences by treatment
## start by plotting scatterplot colour by denisty of points
scatterplot3d(TotalData$X, TotalData$Y, TotalData$Z, color = TotalData$Flow.rate, pch = 20, xlab = "X Axis (m)", ylab = "Y Axis (m)", zlab = "Z Axis (m)", cex.symbols = 0.5, )

##  Will subset Totaldata into each set of variables and try plotting this again
