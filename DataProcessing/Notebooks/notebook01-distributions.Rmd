Plot and fit distributions of variables

```{r}

load("C:\\Users\\nicoleh3\\Documents\\Post-doc\\krill-tank-code\\Total Data Merged File.Rda")

hist(log10(TotalData$v),
     xlab = "Velocity (Log^10 mm/s)")

```

Histogram of Velocity of all data blah blah blah

Log distribution, 0's make up 2% of all data

```{r}
10^mean(log10(TotalData$v[TotalData$v>0]))
sd(log10(TotalData$v[TotalData$v>0]))

```
Now we're going to plot each unique krill and their bimodality with a dip test (less than 0.05 is multimodality)


```{r}
ind <- unique(TotalData$D_V_T)
length(ind)
library(diptest)
library(DescTools)

for (i in 1:length(ind)){
  
vels <- (TotalData$v[TotalData$D_V_T==ind[i]])
vels <- log10(vels[vels>0])
d <- dip.test(vels)

s <- Skew(vels)


  hist(log10(TotalData$v[TotalData$D_V_T==ind[i]]),
       breaks = 50,
     xlab = "Velocity (Log^10 mm/s)",
     main = s)  ## change to d$p.value to print the p-value as the title instead
}
```
Now we'll make a table of d$pavlue, skew, means and sd, and compare amongst treatments


```{r}


```
